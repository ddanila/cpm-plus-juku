# CP/M Plus post-baseline feature plan

Status: **PLANNED; START AFTER THE NETWORK-FIRST PHYSICAL BASELINE IS FROZEN**

This document complements the hardware- and ROM-focused
[`network-first-rom-plan.md`](network-first-rom-plan.md). That plan remains the
acceptance authority for the first automatic network-ROM release. This one
records the operating-system, distribution, native-BIOS, and service work that
becomes safe after that baseline is repeatable on physical Juku hardware.

The port is CP/M Plus 3.1 for the strict Intel 8080 and is deliberately
non-banked. A future feature must not weaken the stock-ROM/RAM-BIOS reference,
the 19,200-baud NetDisk-v3 baseline, or the measured 39,168-byte transient
program area.

## Priority 0: freeze the physical baseline

Before adding user-facing or protocol features:

- complete repeated cold boots, local display and keyboard, sequential read,
  write/erase, warm boot, host-loss, and live reconnect checks on CS00015;
- preserve exact ROM, CP/M payload, disk, host, and programmer hashes;
- either obtain the final V15 completion reply or explicitly accept a first
  valid NetDisk request as the independently recorded execution confirmation;
- reproduce every physical failure through real firmware branches and device
  timing in simulation;
- publish one immutable candidate package and its acceptance record.

The compatibility adapter remains the reference until a replacement matches
this matrix. Higher baud rates, write-back caching, and additional recovery
menus are not release blockers.

## Priority 1: usable system distribution

The current A: image is a deliberately small qualification volume. Turn it
into a useful CP/M Plus distribution without mixing hardware bring-up with
unreviewed binaries:

- add legally redistributable CP/M Plus utilities such as `PIP`, `SHOW`,
  `SET`, `DEVICE`, `DATE`, `SUBMIT`, and `HELP` where their provenance permits;
- retain a minimal recovery A: profile containing CCP, diagnostics, status,
  disk tools, and documentation;
- provide a separate applications/games B: image using native Juku geometry;
- support `PROFILE.SUB` or an equivalent configurable initial command;
- add an opt-in museum/demo profile only after normal warm boot and reconnect
  remain deterministic;
- generate volume contents, provenance, free-space reports, and hashes from
  the reproducible build.

No third-party tool enters a distributed image without a recorded source,
license, version, and checksum.

## Priority 2: native CP/M 3 BIOS services

The existing 32-entry CP/M 3 BIOS is genuine, but deliberately delegates the
first seventeen hardware calls to the qualified CP/M-compatible adapter and
keeps several optional CP/M 3 entries conservative. Replace these only in
measured, independently testable increments:

- provide a real character-device table and CP/M 3 console/list/auxiliary
  assignment rather than placeholder device entries;
- implement host-supplied date/time through the CP/M 3 `TIME` call without
  making boot or disk availability depend on a clock server;
- evaluate `MULTIO` against bounded NetDisk multi-record replies;
- give `FLUSH` explicit semantics before introducing any write cache;
- make device initialization and live status report useful configuration and
  failure information;
- keep `MOVE` verified for overlap and boundary behavior;
- retain bank selection and cross-bank movement as documented stubs unless
  real banked memory hardware is added.

Each native service must retain a compatibility fixture and prove the same
command, framebuffer, disk, reconnect, and memory-map behavior before it
replaces the adapter path.

## Priority 3: configuration, console, and localization

- consume the ROM-latched S21 configuration through a versioned ABI query;
- use S21 bit 0 for the final automatic-network-boot policy;
- share S21 bits 2:1 between ROM and CP/M for 40x24, 53x24, 64x20, and 80x24;
- expose raw and decoded S21 values in both host logs and a target status tool;
- add selectable English, Estonian, and Russian translation/font banks without
  duplicating the renderer;
- retain the edge-connected CP437 pseudographic subset for text interfaces;
- add a small per-machine key remap for dead or nonstandard keys;
- consider ROM-assisted clear, scroll, or bulk console output only when its
  measured call-gate cost beats the current helper;
- add a bounded bulk N4 output operation if character-at-a-time remote output
  becomes a practical debugging bottleneck.

Local screen and keyboard remain authoritative when remote console service is
absent, interrupted, or rejected.

## Priority 4: diagnostics and observability

Grow the shared `DIAG` and status facilities from the same `juku-common`
sources used by ROM diagnostics:

- CPU, memory/address, RAM, PIT, USART, video, keyboard, refresh, and ROM-ABI
  tests, with destructive tests clearly separated;
- a resident memory-map report covering loader, BDOS, BIOS, adapter, TPA top,
  ROM ABI, and mutable work areas;
- concise ROM, CP/M system, protocol, disk-image, host, and build identities;
- raw/decoded S21 configuration and active video/locale settings;
- the last POST stage, bootstrap retry/failure reason, cold/warm marker, disk
  recovery reason, and server reconnect count;
- an unattended machine-readable result channel over N4 that cannot starve
  disk or local console service.

The ROM should retain a small fixed RAM boot-status record so failures can be
explained after recovery or on a machine without a monitor.

## Priority 5: NetDisk performance and media safety

Retain measured `DIR`, sequential-read, and write baselines for every change,
separating wire, target copy/CRC, console, and host scheduling time.

- cache predictable directory and allocation records;
- keep independent per-drive read-ahead and invalidation state;
- coalesce bounded sequential records and compare them with CP/M 3 `MULTIO`;
- add a protocol capability exchange rather than inferring features from a
  banner or host identity;
- support multiple host-advertised volumes and native Juku B: geometry;
- provide explicit read-only, writable-copy, and snapshot-backed modes;
- preserve synchronous write-through as the correctness baseline;
- introduce write caching only with specified flush, warm-boot, retry,
  disconnect, and power-loss behavior;
- keep NetDisk v3 as the compatibility path when experimenting with a later
  block-transfer protocol.

Directory prefetch and bounded sequential coalescing are the first performance
experiments. They have high expected value and do not require risking a write
cache.

## Priority 6: manifests and recovery policy

- add a host-visible boot manifest containing length, load and entry address,
  protocol/ABI requirements, and build identity;
- let the host advertise available system and data images without Janet
  station identity;
- consider two system slots or a last-known-good server image;
- expose capability negotiation for ROM ABI, NetDisk, console, time, and
  diagnostic services;
- keep recovery selection automatic or concealed until the network-only
  baseline is stable—do not regrow a mandatory ROM menu;
- treat baud rates above 19,200 as separately named experiments, retaining the
  proven mode-2/count-4 clock as production default.

Cryptographic authentication is deferred until its EPROM, wire, and 8080
decode costs are measured. Checksums and reproducible build identities remain
mandatory.

## Completion order

1. Freeze and publish the physical network-first baseline.
2. Build a useful, licensed, reproducible A:/B: distribution.
3. Add status, shared diagnostics, boot records, and complete S21 integration.
4. Implement date/time and character-device support as native CP/M 3 calls.
5. Improve read performance and multi-volume media handling.
6. Add further native BIOS and protocol features only with measured benefit.

This order keeps the already successful port usable at every milestone and
prevents performance or convenience work from obscuring hardware regressions.
